Onion Encryption Tool - Layered Security for Your Data

The Onion Encryption Tool is a robust and secure application designed to protect your data using a multi-layered encryption approach inspired by the Tor network's onion routing. Each layer of encryption wraps your data, ensuring that even if one layer is compromised, the subsequent layers maintain its confidentiality.

Key Features:
Layered Encryption: Apply multiple encryption algorithms (e.g., RSA, AES, ChaCha20) in successive layers to enhance security.
Customizable Layers: Choose the number and type of encryption layers to suit your security needs.
Key Exchange Security: Use RSA or ECC for secure key exchanges, ensuring maximum protection during data transmission.
User-Friendly Interface: Intuitive design for easy encryption and decryption of files and messages.
Cross-Platform Compatibility: Works seamlessly on Windows, macOS, and Linux.
Ideal for Sensitive Data: Protects critical information, such as financial records, private communications, and proprietary files.
Whether you're safeguarding personal data or securing sensitive organizational files, the Onion Encryption Tool delivers unparalleled protection by creating layers of encryption that only authorized users can peel away.

Secure your data, one layer at a time.
